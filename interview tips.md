* You should have at least one:

  - example of an interesting technical problem you solved
  - example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame
  - example of leadership or ownership
  - story about what you should have done differently in a past project
  - piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
  - question about the company's product/business
  - question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)

* **Nerd out about stuff**. Show you're proud of what you've done, you're amped about what they're doing, and you have opinions about languages and workflows.

* **Make it feel like you're on a team**. The interviewer wants to know what it feels like to work through a problem with you, so make the interview feel collaborative.]

*  If you get to choose between coding on paper and coding on a whiteboard, **always choose the whiteboard.**

* **Think out loud**

  * Say what might work. Say what you thought could work and why it doesn't work. 

* #### take it slow

  *  You don't win anything for speed and you're more likely to annoy your interviewer by cutting her off or appearing to jump to conclusions.

#### Get Unstuck

* Sometimes you'll get stuck.
* Keep in mind that the interviewer usually cares more about your ability to cleverly poke the problem from a few different angles than your ability to stumble into the correct answer. 
*  When hope seems lost, keep poking.
* **Draw pictures.** Don't waste time trying to think in your headâ€”think on the board
* **Solve a simpler version of the problem.** Not sure how to find the 4th largest item in the set?
* **Write a naive, inefficient solution and optimize it later.** Use brute force. Do whatever it takes to get *some kind* of answer.
* **Think about the bounds on space and runtime.** If you're not sure if you can optimize your solution, think about it out loud. For example:

#### Get your thoughts down

* **Call a helper function and keep moving.** **.** If you can't immediately think of how to implement some part of your algorithm, big or small, just skip over it. 
* **Don't worry about syntax.** Just breeze through it. Revert to English if you have to. Just say you'll get back to it.
* **Use descriptive variable names**

#### clean up your code

* **Walk through your solution by hand, out loud, with an example input.** 
* **Look for off-by-one errors.** Should your for loop use a "<=<=" instead of a "<<"?
* **Test edge cases.** These might include empty sets, single-item sets, or negative numbers. Bonus: mention unit tests!
